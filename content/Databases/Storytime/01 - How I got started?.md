All naive software developers start their cloud journey with a popular cloud provider. My company began its journey with an AWS RDS setup on a c6g.xlarge instance. Things went smoothly, powered by cloud credits, until those credits inevitably ran out.

The next day, I was handed the responsibility of migrating all data from AWS to Azure. The approach I took was to use `mysqldump` to export the data and then load it into the Azure MySQL server using the MySQL CLI.

**The Dump Command**

```shell
mysqldump --host=xxxxxx.com \
          --port=3306 \
          --user=username \
          --password='xxxxxx' \
          --database database_name \
          --single-transaction \
          --routines \
          --triggers \
          --events \
          --set-gtid-purged=OFF > /data/backup.sql
```

**The Load Command** To load the dumped data into Azure, I used:

```shell
mysql --host=azure_host.com \
      --port=3306 \
      --user=username \
      --password='xxxxxx' \
      database_name < /data/backup.sql
```

If you want to learn more about `mysqldump`, I highly recommend exploring [mysqldump.guru](https://mysqldump.guru/what-is-mysqldump.html) and the [official documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/mysqldump.html) for a deeper dive into its features and options.

However, this migration came with numerous challenges:

1. **Large Dump Size**: The size of the dump was significantly large, leading to a cumbersome migration. Transferring large SQL files over the network and processing them can become a logistical nightmare.
2. **Slow Process**: Both dumping and loading the data turned out to be painfully slow. The performance of `mysqldump` for large databases can be a bottleneck, especially when moving from one cloud provider to another.
3. **Replication Delays**: Due to the slow process, the binlogs on AWS started to expire before I could even begin replication. This forced us to start from scratch multiple times until we figured out a workaround.
4. **Network Latency**: The migration involved moving data between two cloud providers, which increased the risk of network latency issues and connection drops, further adding to the migration woes.
5. **Downtime**: The time required to dump, transfer, and restore the data translated to a significant downtime for the application, which was unacceptable for the business.
6. **Storage Space**: The intermediate storage of the large dump files added pressure on available disk space, both during the export and the subsequent import.

These challenges made it clear that while `mysqldump` is often the first tool that comes to mind for database migrations, it is not always the best choice for large-scale databases or migrations between cloud providers.

If you're planning a similar migration, consider alternatives such as using logical replication tools, leveraging cloud-specific database migration services, or breaking the migration into smaller, more manageable parts. These alternatives can help mitigate issues like downtime and speed up the data transfer process significantly.
