### Welcome to Blog

Hi, I'm **Mitrajit Chandra**, and this is where I share the things I learn, the challenges I face, and the solutions I find. As an engineer at Outbox Labs and a mind behind products like ReachInbox and Zapmail, I’ve had the privilege of diving deep into various tech stacks, product management processes, and entrepreneurial strategies.

Through this blog, I aim to document my experiences, Technical deep-dives and tutorials, and lessons learned. Whether it’s about the latest tech trends, challenges I’ve encountered with scaling, or simple "aha" moments, you’ll find it all here.

I believe in the power of learning from each other, so I hope my stories will inspire, educate, and even spark a conversation.
